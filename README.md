# Why does this exist?
There are several decent new tab extensions already available, but many lack customization and prompt you for paid subscriptions from time to time. RagTab is an open-source alternative to those extensions.

# How do I install it?
## Recommended installation
- [Install from Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ragtab/)
- I'm considering adding RagTab to the Microsoft Edge store for the next release
- Chrome web store costs money to add an extension. You won't see RagTab there unless people actually start using it.

## Install from source code
1) Clone this repository
2) In Firefox, go to the add-ons page. Then click the gear and go to "Debug Add-Ons"
3) Click "Load temporary Add-On" and select manifest.json

# What's up with the To-Do list.
The to-do list should be considered in alpha, which is why it is disabled by default. While the to-do list itself is relatively stable, my site-wide account system is in need of stability upgrades and the login page needs to be optomized for small windows. If you wish to use it, use the following URL in to-do settings:
