# RagTab
An open-source alternative to the Momentum new tab page.

# Why does this exist?
- I was bored
- Edge randomly removed Momentum from my computer.
- I was tired of Momentum nagging me to upgrade.
- I wanted a new-tab page that could use my To-Do list

# How do I install it?
## Install the Extension
1) Either download this repository or clone it. Cloning it will allow you to recieve updates by pulling.
2) On a chromium based browser (Edge, Chrome, Brave, Vivialdi, etc...), navigate to the extensions page. The URL will be something like `edge://extensions/` or `chrome://extensions/`
3) Enable developer mode. This will be a toggle switch somewhere on the extensions page, in a different place depending on the browser
4) Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder you cloned or downloaded.
5) OPTIONAL: Disable the developer mode extensions warning. https://www.ghacks.net/2017/07/04/hide-chromes-disable-developer-mode-extensions-warning/

# Why isn't the to-do list fully open-source?
If I didn't keep my PHP private, my friends would immediately find a way to break it. The to do list widget can be pointed at a different webpage or disabled completely in config.js if you don't like it. If you do choose to use the To-Do list, please keep in mind that it is in beta and therefore contains its fair share of bugs.

# Can I use my own background images?
Yes! All you need to do is modify backgrounds.js to include the URLs of the images you want to add. RagTab **cannot** access your computer's filesystem, so please put your images in the extension directory or store them online. Also keep in mind that storing your images online will cause RagTab to display a blank white background when your computer is offline.

# I want Google instead of DuckDuckGo!
The search engine can be configured by setting SEARCH_ENGINE in config.js. 0 is DuckDuckGo, 1 is Google, 2 is Wikipedia

# How can I set a different search engine besides DuckDuckGo, Google, and Wikipedia
As long as you are familiar with JSON, you should be able to add any search engine. For these instructions, I will use craigslist.org as an example
1) Search something on the website you want to add.
2) Get everything in the URL that comes before the search term. In this case my URL was `https://sfbay.craigslist.org/d/for-sale/search/sss?query=vr%20headset&sort=rel`, so I got `https://sfbay.craigslist.org/d/for-sale/search/sss?query=`.
3) Add the following to engines.json, make sure to put it before the closing `]`:
```json 
{
		"name": "[Search Engine Name]",
		"url": "[URL From Step 2]"
}
```
4) Make sure your engines.json looks something like this:
(Note that the last item does not have a comma at the end. You may want to use an online JSON validator to double check.)
```json 
[
	{
		"name": "DuckDuckGo",
		"url": "https://duckduckgo.com?q="
	},
	{
		"name": "Google",
		"url": "https://www.google.com/search?q="
	},
	{
		"name": "Wikipedia",
		"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search="
	},
	{
		"name": "Craigslist",
		"url": "https://sfbay.craigslist.org/d/for-sale/search/sss?query="
	}
 ]
```
5) Finally, you need to set SEARCH_ENGINE in config.js. Computers start counting at 0, not 1, so in my example I set SEARCH_ENGINE to 3 for Craigslist.
